## Downloading Resources

Before getting started with these resources, the first step is to download them into your computer. There is two ways to do this, using Git, or downloading the files simply as a .zip file. We recommend having our resources in a C:/Users/user/Documents/Quanser folder. 

### With Git

2. Open your Documents folder and open a windows terminal in that folder. 
3. Run the following command `git clone https://github.com/quanser/Quanser_Academic_Resources.git Quanser` this will create the Quanser directory and copy the contents of this repo in there.

### Without Git

2. Click the green Code button at the top of this GitHub page, click _Download ZIP_ at the bottom of the menu that pops up. 
3. Unzip the folder in your system. 
4. Go into _Quanser_Academic_Resources-main_ (you see the folders 0_libraries, 1_setup ...). Copy all the contents of that folder into your newly created Documents/Quanser folder.
