# Definition files for generating the breakout mapping of data stored with the "To Host File" or "To File" blocks.
# Any line starting with the hash (#) symbol will be ignored (like this line)
# The fields are separated by commas (,)
#
# The column format is as follows:
#
# variable_name, length, Description/Comments
#
# variable_name: The broken out data are assigned to for that field
# length    : The size of the vector associated with the variable name (min 1, if 0, ignored)
# Description/Comments : Documentation comments, will appear as comment in the generated script
#
